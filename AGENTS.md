# CBE Emulator Reverse Engineering Guide

## Scope

This repository mixes three closely related workstreams:

- emulator runtime work under `src/`
- reverse-engineering notes and protocol findings under `docs/`
- tooling and extractors under `tools/`

Treat the repository as a long-running reverse-engineering project. Prefer preserving evidence, documenting hypotheses, and making the smallest change that unlocks the next verified step.

## Repository Map

- `src/`: Unicorn-based emulator and platform/runtime shims
- `tools/`: repeatable helper scripts for disassembly, extraction, decoding, and validation
- `docs/net_mock_protocol.md`: currently verified network mock behavior for Jianghu OL
- `docs/re/battle-mainline.md`: battle parser/state model and experiment gates
- `docs/re/server-mainline.md`: short current entry point for private-server work
- `docs/re/`: durable reverse-engineering notes, protocol docs, memory maps, and session logs
- `firmware/`: firmware images, unpacked pieces, and extraction manifests
- `samples/`: packet captures, screenshots, save data, code snippets, and other evidence
- `server/`: future private-server implementation and protocol test harnesses
- `.codex/skills/cbe-reverse-engineering/`: project-local skill that teaches Codex how to work in this repo

## Working Rules

1. Keep raw evidence separate from interpretations.
2. Mark uncertain findings as `hypothesis` until confirmed by code, logs, memory inspection, or repeatable runtime behavior.
3. Prefer implementing emulator or server behavior that matches the observed client/platform contract over patching game logic to force progress.
4. Do not silently replace existing reverse-engineering notes. Extend them and preserve prior findings unless they are clearly disproven.
5. Keep filenames stable once they start being referenced by notes, scripts, or prompts.
6. Do not add runtime guards, hook branches, or emulator shims that skip the game's own parser, scene, draw, or state-machine logic just to force progress. If the game reaches bad state, treat it as evidence of a missing platform/server/resource contract and fix that upstream contract instead.

## Documentation Rules

When you learn something durable, update the closest matching document in `docs/re/`:

- `docs/re/firmware-map.md`: firmware layout, segments, loaders, container formats
- `docs/re/protocol.md`: packet formats, event sequencing, field semantics
- `docs/re/battle-mainline.md`: battle parser/state model, static flow, experiment gates, rejected hypotheses
- `docs/re/server-mainline.md`: current service-side target, active blocker, and extraction boundary
- `docs/re/runtime-contracts.md`: platform APIs, screen lifecycle, timers, file I/O, VM semantics
- `docs/re/open-questions.md`: unresolved hypotheses and next experiments
- `docs/re/session-log.md`: short dated notes for what changed and what was verified

Keep entries compact and evidence-driven. Each important claim should mention how it was established, such as string search, xref path, trace log, or runtime observation.

## Reverse-Engineering Workflow

Start from the smallest reliable source of truth:

1. static evidence from firmware, CBE payloads, symbols, strings, imports, and cross-references
2. emulator logs and runtime traces
3. packet captures or mock-server transcripts
4. behavioral inference only when the first three are insufficient

Preferred sequence for new features:

1. identify the client/runtime entry point
2. document inputs, outputs, and side effects
3. implement the minimum emulator or server behavior needed
4. verify with a repeatable run
5. write the result back into `docs/re/`

For private-server work, use this tighter loop:

1. read `docs/re/server-mainline.md` and the tail of `docs/re/session-log.md`
2. inspect the current request/response in `bin/logs/net_packets.log` or `unhandled_packet`
3. map it to the narrowest `src/mock-server.c` mock builder and matching client parser
4. validate one packet family before changing broader server structure
5. promote confirmed behavior into `docs/re/protocol.md`, then extract stable builders/tests to `server/`

Avoid rereading the full protocol notebook unless a specific section is needed; it contains useful
evidence but also historical experiments.

For battle packet work, read `docs/re/battle-mainline.md` first and report progress by its gates
(`G1` through `G9`). Do not add new battle packet variants unless they target a named unknown or
reject/advance a specific gate.

## Editing Rules

- Reuse existing helpers before adding new ad hoc code paths.
- For network mock behavior, prefer helper builders in `src/mock-server.c` over handwritten packet assembly.
- Keep diagnostic logging scoped and easy to remove after verification.
- Trace-only hooks are acceptable when they do not alter guest registers, memory, return values, or control flow. Hooks that `vm_bx()` around client code, suppress draw/parser calls, clamp client state, or skip table updates require an explicit post-boundary user request and should be treated as temporary experiments, not project fixes.
- Avoid broad refactors while chasing an unverified reverse-engineering hypothesis.
- For runtime/UI repro steps, do not add or use automatic clicking/input by default. The user drives manual interaction, and Codex should prefer inspecting the resulting logs and traces unless the user explicitly asks for input automation.

## Validation

After meaningful changes:

1. rebuild with `build.bat` or `make` when relevant
2. note what scenario was exercised
3. record whether the result is confirmed, partial, or still hypothesis

If a task depends on files that should not be committed, place them under `firmware/raw/` or `samples/raw/` and keep manifests or notes in tracked files.
